Analysis:

This a program that has a maze which is an array that the user should navigate from room
to room until s/he reaches one of two exits.

Design:
1. The program has a command window driven menu.
2. The program is a maze game which allows the user to choose a room to spawn, to travel
	from to find the exit of the maze.
3. There are also special rooms that you can travel through to gain points.

Use:

	The game will run in the command window terminal. It will display the rules of the game and the maze, which
then right after the game(program) will ask the user where does to spawn the player's character. The rules of the 
game is as follows:

a) This is a maze game where you try and get to the exit one move at a time.
b) There are 6(six) rooms and 2(two) exits. At the start of the game you choose where you want to spawn into or begin in the map.
c) From there you get to either exits to beat the game.
d) You can also find one of the rooms that you can spawn into to gain extra points!

The game also will display a key so the player can know what the symbols in the game are.

Key: 	clover = special room
	Heart = Player's Character (You)
	Diamond = The path you've taken
	Hollow Smilely Face = The inner walls of the maze
	Lines = The outer walls of the maze
	Spade = The Exits 	

After beating the maze, the program now shows you your path that you took to get to one of two exits in the maze. It
will tell you how many move you have had to make along that path and based on where you spawn it can tell the player 
the least amount of moves it would've taken the player to get to the nearest exit.
